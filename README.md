# Sequoia Snow's Emacs Configuration

This is a **very simple** emacs configuration used by me personally,
don't feel obligated to use it as well. However, it works for me, and,
if it can help you, so much the better.

If you use this there may be a while where the startup asks to install
packaged, to change this, edit the `ensure-package-installed` function.
